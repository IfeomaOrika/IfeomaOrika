Hi guys! Ifeoma Orika here. 

I am an aspiring web3 developer. I am currently taking London App Brewery's course on Full-stack web development. 

I am really passionate about the whole ideas and ideals web3 advocates. This is my reason for deciding to learn the technologies that power web3. 

I believe that with consistency and putting in the work I will get to the place I aspire to be. 
I do project-based learning. I learn a concept in JavaScript and Solidity and I do a project on that concept to improve my skills.

All my projects are contained in my GitHub repository. 

I also write little notes on 
* what my project was all about, 
* my process, 
* my live site, 
* my stack for the project, 
* what I learned, 
* what I realized I need to improve on, 
* continued development 
* and useful resource
